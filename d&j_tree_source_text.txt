Josh: Drake.
Drake: What?
Josh: Where's the door hole?
Drake: It goes right there, see I drew it with a magic marker.
Josh: You were supposed to cut it out with the power saw.
Drake: Dude, I'm gonna!
Josh: Oh really?
Drake: Yes!
Josh: So go get the power saw.
Drake: Okay, I will. [tries to walk through the wall where the painted door is] I see the problem.
Josh: Oh do ya?!
