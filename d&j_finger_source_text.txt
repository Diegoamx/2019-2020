Little Josh: I'm gonna buy a foam finger.
Little Drake: Um, could you not talk to me?
Little Josh: Haha! you're funny. Wanna be friends?
Little Drake: If I say yes, will you stop talking to me?
Little Josh: Um, pardon me, but I think you're next in line.
Little Drake: Yeah, I know. Hey girls? Why don't you cut in you can all buy foam fingers.
[A group of little girls whoop while cutting and get in line to buy all the foam fingers except the last one]
Little Josh: Hey, no cutsies! Um, I was in line! [the little girls leave after buying almost all of the foam fingers] Ladies!
Little Drake: Got any foam fingers left?
Vendor: Just one.
Little Drake: Good. I'll buy it. So he can't have it!
Little Josh: Heh!?
Vendor: Here you go, the last foam finger.
Little Drake: Ha-ha. I got the last foam finger!
Little Josh: Daddy! [little Drake hits him] You thumped me!
Little Drake: Did not.
Little Josh: Daddy!
[Little Drake tackles Little Josh, causing a fight for the last foam finger]
Vendor: Cops! Cops!
[they continue fighting until the cops show up, the flashback ends]
Josh: And then the cops had to come break it up!
